# 8bitALU
Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) Design Project
Project Overview
This project involves the design and implementation of an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), capable of performing both arithmetic and logical operations. The ALU processes two 8-bit inputs and outputs an 8-bit result based on the operation selected. The project was designed and simulated using Verilog, and hardware validation was done using an FPGA.

The ALU is capable of performing the following operations:
Logical Operations: AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NOR, XNOR.
Arithmetic Operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division.
Other Operations: Bit shifts (Left/Right), Increment, Decrement, Set, Clear, Swap, Reverse bits.
Processor Operations
The implemented operations include:

IDLE: No operation.
ADD: Y = A + B
SUB: Y = A - B
MUL: Y = A * B
DIV: Y = A / B
AND: Y = A & B
OR: Y = A | B
NOT: Y = ~A
XOR: Y = A ^ B
XNOR: Y = ~(A ^ B)
Left/Right Shift: Shifts bits of Y by 2 positions.
Other: Clear, Set, Increment, Decrement, Swap values, Reverse bits.
